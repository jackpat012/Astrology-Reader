### A JavaScript program designed to take in a user's birthday, tell the user their Astrological sign, and return three randomized "readings" based on what third of the year it currently is. 

#### Known Issues:
* Does not currently account for leap years, should not affect user output however.
* Years are not divided into exact thirds.

#### Features to be added:
* Optimization of code.
* More possible readings, either through expansion of readings arrays or through predefined arrays with randomized subvariables (such as through \`.... ${x} ..... ${y}...\` etc.
